## Key Features

- **ML-Driven Analytics**: Harness the power of machine learning to derive nuanced insights from vast datasets, offering a deeper understanding of clinical scenarios.
  
- **Clinical Data Insights**: Offers granular analysis of CARTO clinical data, including ablation analysis, providing clinicians with a holistic view of patient data.
  
- **Case Revisit & Extension**: An interactive online system that not only allows for revisiting cases but also extends them with intelligently managed questionnaires and forms, enhancing the depth of clinical data available.
  
- **Highway of cloud connectivity**: As CARTONET evolves, it progressively leverages the CloudPillar platform-as-a-service, bolstering synergy between analytics and cybersecurity, and paving the way for future integrations, compliance to regulations and capabilities.

## CARTONET's Architectural Excellence

CARTONET's architecture is founded on a **Hub/Spoke** topology, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and domains:

- **Network Manager & Azure Firewall**: At the heart of the hub, these elements govern network access between various security zones or spokes.

- **Frontend Spoke**: Strategically isolated from sensitive resources, ensuring user interfaces remain secure.

- **DMZ Spoke**: A clean zone dedicated exclusively to the Web Application Firewall (WAF), Application Gateway, and Listeners.

The flow within CARTONET is orchestrated by a Logic App, ensuring processes are streamlined and consume only relevant resources. **Microservices** leverage scalability optimizations with lowest marginal costs and utter cybersecurity, and all access to storage is managed via frontier microservices, allowing for adaptability in architectural developments.

In terms of security, CARTONET stands unparalleled. All data is encrypted, whether at rest or in transit. Communications are authenticated through the **Open Service Mesh**, and every request is authenticated using **Azure Active Directory** and custom tokens.
